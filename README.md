# TRX4-Diff-Controller
Allows the diff servos on a Traxxas TRX4 to be controlled with one channel

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This was built around using an Arduino Pro for size reasons

Things you will need:
Arduino pro or similar
Servo connectors
FTDI adapter if using arduino pro without USB

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Wiring:

The connection to your Reciver goes to pin 2

Front servo goes to pin 3

Back servo goes to pin 4

Power and ground can all be connected.(The arduino pro does allow voltage of upto 12v. So feel free to use HV servos if you please!)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Testing:
The LED onboard will act as follows

solid for position 1

slow flash to position 2

fast flash for position 3
